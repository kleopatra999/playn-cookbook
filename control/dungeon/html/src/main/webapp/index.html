    <h1>Top-down Dungeon-crawler Controls</h1>
    <p>
      This recipe shows how to walk a character around a top-down 2D space, as is common in dungeon
      crawlers and Zelda-like games. In this recipe, the character is always in the center of the
      screen and the dungeon scrolls as they walk around.

    <h3>Exercises</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> If you're not perfectly lined up with a hallway, the game won't let you enter. Modify
        the collision detection code to ease you toward the center of the tile if you're walking
        toward a tile that is passable, but are bumping into the corner of an impassable
        tile. </li>
      <li> Reveal dungeon areas as the player walks around. Most commonly one also reveals a whole
        room as soon as the player walks into it, but you could also just reveal the 3x3 area
        around the player and force them to map out each room as well. </li>
    </ul>
